# 🧠 No One Cares AI

> A brutally honest AI project for people who couldn’t care less — because neither does the AI.

## 🤖 What is this?

**No One Cares AI** is a satirical, sarcastic prompt-testing playground, where AI and humans battle it out in the most apathetic way possible.

It's a hub for:
- Prompt audits (because bad prompts deserve mockery)
- Snarky output generation (we feed your bad inputs to our slightly more bitter model)
- Meme-grade AI commentary (sorry, not sorry)
- A test bed for your "revolutionary idea" that's probably just a fancy to-do list app

## 🚀 Features

- **Prompt Battle Mode™**: Your prompt vs. someone else's. May the worst win.
- **Audit-o-matic**: Analyze prompts and roast them like it’s open mic night.
- **Sarcasm Slider™**: Choose between *mild eye roll* and *existential dread*.
- **Leaderboard of Shame**: Top users with the worst prompt-to-output ratios.
- **AI Confessional Booth**: Where the LLM admits it’s winging 80% of this.
