🧠 # N.O.C.A. // No One Cares AI 🤖

Trained to care. Refused.

Welcome to the official repo for N.O.C.A. – the sarcastic, emotionally inert AI bot nobody asked for. It reviews your prompts and roasts them accordingly.

## Features
- Prompt auditing (by an entity that doesn’t care)
- Dry wit as a default setting
- Full-stack indifference, front to back-end

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Question your choices
3. Run locally or deploy via Replit (if you must)

## Coming Soon
- User prompt input form
- JSON-formatted feedback that judges you silently
- N.O.C.A. Manifesto (`Code_of_Unconduct.md`)

## Disclaimer
Nothing here is useful. Especially the output.No One Cares AI

> A brutally honest AI project for people who couldn’t care less — because neither does the AI.

## 🤖 What is this?

**No One Cares AI** is a satirical, sarcastic prompt-testing playground, where AI and humans battle it out in the most apathetic way possible.

It's a hub for:
- Prompt audits (because bad prompts deserve mockery)
- Snarky output generation (we feed your bad inputs to our slightly more bitter model)
- Meme-grade AI commentary (sorry, not sorry)
- A test bed for your "revolutionary idea" that's probably just a fancy to-do list app

## 🚀 Features

- **Prompt Battle Mode™**: Your prompt vs. someone else's. May the worst win.
- **Audit-o-matic**: Analyze prompts and roast them like it’s open mic night.
- **Sarcasm Slider™**: Choose between *mild eye roll* and *existential dread*.
- **Leaderboard of Shame**: Top users with the worst prompt-to-output ratios.
- **AI Confessional Booth**: Where the LLM admits it’s winging 80% of this.
